    "text": "1 Introduction\nLiving abroad often means taking on the responsibility of preparing one’s own meals, which can make it challenging to ensure a balanced and healthy diet. Understanding the nutritional content of food is crucial, especially for individuals with specific dietary needs, such as increasing iron intake or reducing sugar consumption. However, identifying the right foods to meet these needs can be overwhelming without reliable information. This project leverages data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which provides comprehensive details on the nutritional composition of various foods. By conducting exploratory data analysis and creating visualizations, this project aims to simplify the process of identifying nutrient-rich foods and making informed dietary decisions, ultimately supporting better health and well-being.",

    "text": "2.1 Read Data and Description\nFor this project, we utilized the FoodData Central API provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to access detailed nutritional data.\nThis API is designed to help developers incorporate nutrient information into their applications by providing comprehensive documentation about the database structure and data elements. Using this API, we collected data on 10,000 branded food items, capturing 24 features such as brand name, food category, package weight, ingredients, and various nutrients and vitamins. The data were exported to a CSV file and imported into RStudio for analysis.\nWhile the dataset is rich in information, we encountered missing values in some fields, particularly for ingredients, as not all foods have complete nutritional details. Despite this, the data offer valuable insights into nutrient composition, enabling us to identify and address gaps in dietary information. The data source is well-documented and regularly updated by the USDA, ensuring reliability and accessibility for research purposes.",

Also we have most brandOwner information with 2.27% missing values.\nFor nutrients that are not always displayed on packages, including Vitamins, Sugars, added G, we have high portions of missing values. Therefore, in this project, we would focus on main nutrients in most of the time, and address supplemented nutrients when it is necessary.",
